In my role as a Data Analyst, I undertook a project focused on advertisement analytics without specific brand affiliation. The dataset, origin unknown, centered around ad interactions, employing Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Tableau for visualization.

Through Python, I conducted a thorough EDA, extracting valuable insights into user engagement, click-through rates, and ad performance. Utilizing Tableau, I translated these findings into visually impactful dashboards.

The project's climax was a concise presentation to a Consumer Insight Specialist, highlighting key trends and actionable recommendations. Despite the ambiguous origin of the data, the insights provided a foundation for strategic decision-making in advertising campaigns, showcasing the power of data analysis in driving effective consumer targeting strategies.
